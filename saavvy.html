            <p>The project objective was to design a personal finance app that helps people save money quickly in preparation for a big purchase or expenditure.</p>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>I analyzed other popular personal finance apps on the app store and identified a problem, opportunity within the marketplace, and solution presented by my app. I hypothesized that many personal finance apps are overcomplicated and a lot of users simply need help saving quickly for a particular reason or big expenditure. A tool that could analyze a user’s actual finances/spending habits could then provide personalized and actionable advice that would aid in users saving for their particular goals. This was the key idea in mind that I used to center Saavvy’s design.</p>

            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>Based on the details within the project brief and what I had gathered from potential users as well as existing apps, I identified several key tasks that would need to happen within the app such as registering/linking accounts, creating savings goals, etc. I then used these task flows to create a user flow diagram which would be the basis for my wireframes.</p>

            </picture>
            <h3>Wireframe</h3>
            <p>I sketched my first low fidelity wireframes for the app. This included all of the main screens of the app, those included in my user flow. I then took these and digitized them in Adobe XD to create my mid-fidelity wireframes. During this process, I created additional screens, filling gaps I identified within individual task flows, and I also completed a task analysis with 3 different testers (potential users) by having them test a basic prototype and gathering feedback on their experience. I used their feedback to further refine my mid-fidelity wireframes.</p>

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>Early on in this project, I created a complete brand guidelines document [insert link] that would help me with the final design of my high-fidelity wireframes. This made it so that when it came time to stylize my mid-fidelity wireframes, I could do it fairly quickly because I already had all the design choices and elements picked out.  I drew inspiration for my visual design from open source platforms like Behance, from existing apps like Mint, and I defined the brand voice, vision and mission statements from the details provided to me in the project brief on target users and their needs.</p>

                <h3>Prototype</h3>
                    <p>Here is a prototype of my final screen designs - try it out and let me know what you think! I welcome all constructive feedback to improve my work.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>The cost of living is rising at unprecedented rates and disproportionately to wealth so people need more help now than ever to save money. A finance app that’s simple and provides actionable guidance to help people save as quickly as possible towards big expenditures or milestones in their life is of huge value. Here is my future roadmap for Saavvy to get it ready for the marketplace:
                    In the research phase, I would measure engagement within the app, number of goals set, and the most common savings goals within the beta version.I would also run more usability tests, specifically testing users navigation paths within the app, where they tap and which screens they spend the most time on. In the development phase with future releases, I would fill usability gaps within the app based on research of beta users and focus on developing resources for the most common savings goals first; I would also compile a full library of financial learning material, articles, etc., and, eventually, a website with an on-site blog containing articles on financial wellness and advice.
