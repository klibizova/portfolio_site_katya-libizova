                    The project objective was to design a responsive web app for
                    location-based recommendations that meets the requirements
                    of its users and solves the problems they face with existing
                    location-based recommendation apps. The niche audience I
                    chose to focus on was dog owners; being a dog owner myself,
                    I knew there was a need in the marketplace of existing
                    location-based apps that weren’t really meeting my needs
                    when it came to finding dog-friendly locales in my area. The
                    solution was an app that has an extensive database solely
                    consisting of dog-friendly locales and dog-centered
                    businesses/spaces, with additional filters meant to help
                    users with specific concerns.

                  <h3>Research</h3>
                  <p>
                    During the research phase of the project, I conducted a
                    competitive analysis and user interviews. For my competitive
                    analysis, I analyzed industry leaders Google Maps and AirBnb
                    and identified some weaknesses that presented opportunities
                    for a new app, such as inaccurate, unclear or incomplete
                    location details that would necessitate further research by
                    users on Google Maps and pricing out of key groups of users
                    on AirBnb. I conducted several interviews with potential
                    users that fit my target demo and asked them exploratory
                    questions such as how they normally use location-based
                    recommendation apps, if they’ve ever tried using them to
                    search for dog-friendly locations, what their concerns were
                    for their own dogs outside of the home, and what sort of
                    features they would like to see on a location-based app
                    specific to dog owners.

                  <p>
                    From my research, I came up with my 3 key user personas each
                    with their own needs: The Adventurous Dog Owner, The
                    Metropolite Dog Owner, and the Suburban/Family Dog Owner. I
                    identified key goals that the app would need to meet for all
                    3 and defined the MVP for the app: an extensive database
                    solely consisting of all dog-friendly locales in the area,
                    as well as advanced filters for different types of locale to
                    meet the special needs of owners and their dog (E.g. foot
                    traffic filter on hikes, special needs filters on services,
                    dog friendly amenities on hotels, etc.). Based on the tasks
                    to be done to meet these goals and the screens I knew the
                    app would need, I mapped out a user flow diagram.

                  <p>
                    Referencing the user flow diagram, I then employed the Crazy
                    8 design sprint method to come up with 2 rough sketches of
                    all the main screens I wanted to include in the app, and
                    from those options, chose the following for my first
                    prototype. I created my first prototype using these
                    low-fidelity wireframes and sent it my key users to test the
                    navigation of the app in a simple task analysis, and
                    recorded feedback to be incorporated into the mid-fidelity
                    wireframes.

                  <p>
                    For the visual design of the app, I started out with a
                    moodboard, gathering imagery, colors, design elements and
                    icons that I knew would be reflective of the brand and
                    incorporated into the final wireframes. I sent these
                    wireframes over for a peer review to gather feedback and
                    then made a few tweaks to come up with my final screen
                    designs.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              I received some very positive feedback from testers and
              professional designers verifying the utility of such an app in the
              marketplace. I learned a lot about the full design process, from
              ideation to UX and final wireframes, and experienced first-hand
              how important early user testing is.Plans for further development
              of this app would include additional features, such as a user
              forum for fellow dog owners to connect and share recommendations,
              as well as city-specific travel guides compiled by local experts.
