            The project brief was to design the iOS and Android version of a
            native mobile app, designer’s choice, that followed both iOS and
            Material Design guidelines and solved a specific user problem. I
            chose to design a music-based dating app with the objective of
            helping users find partners on the basis of shared music taste.

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>
              I did competitive research on 3 of the major dating apps on the
              market that are largely used by the target audience demo: Tinder,
              Hinge, and Bumble. This was made easier by the fact I’ve used all
              three myself so I’m very familiar with their interfaces. The
              fundamental issue I found with all three was that they miss the
              mark on interest-based dating - that is, specifically matching
              people on the basis of shared interests, which affects
              compatibility.

            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>
              Based on the huge gap in the marketplace of existing apps, I
              conjured up Ear Buds - a dating app that narrows in on a specific
              interest-based niche, music fans/aficionados, and is specifically
              designed around that as the main focus for matching its users. As
              unique key features, users can plan dates within the app by
              viewing and sharing concerts with their matches, share playlists
              (our modern day mixtapes), and engage in an interactive
              gamification feature. All of this has the goal of leading to more
              in-app matches and better quality dates. Taking into account all
              the familiar required tasks users would have to complete within a
              dating app, as well as tasks involved in the aforementioned
              features, I mapped out a user flow diagram.Rectangles represent
              screens, trapezoids represent user actions, yellow circles
              represent the successful completion of key task flows.

              />
            </picture>
            <h3>Wireframe</h3>
            <p>
              I first sketched paper wireframes for all the screens from my user
              flow diagram, and I then digitized theminto my first set of
              mid-fidelity wireframes, for both iOS and Android devices,
              applying design elements from both the HIG and Material Design
              guidelines for each OS. I added some new screens along the way for
              onboarding/walkthroughs for first-time users, and empty screen
              states. I then sent these mid-fidelity wireframes over to some
              peers for review to make sure all my elements made sense and the
              layouts worked, as well as prototypes to run a navigation test.
              Based on feedback received, I refined these screens and then moved
              on to the final design.

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>
              To come up with the visual design for this project, per my usual
              process, I created a moodboard compiling imagery that captured the
              feeling of the app, drew colors from these images, and created
              some unique design elements that I would use throughout the app,
              and then got to work on my high-fidelity wireframes. I created a
              full prototype (for both iOS and Android versions) and shared it
              with friends/key users for them to test the functionality of the
              app, ease of navigation, and gathered feedback on the design
              elements and anything else they wanted to see. I then tweaked the
              design and added a few new screens (one tester gave me the idea
              that it would be nice to share playlists with matches through the
              app) and had my final set of screens!

            <h3>Prototype</h3>

              Here is a prototype of my final screen designs - try it out and

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              I received overwhelmingly positive feedback from key users/peers
              saying they wish this app existed in the marketplace and that
              they’d love to see it developed, which has been very encouraging
              for me as this was a personal project. Future plans for the
              research and development of the app would be to (1) measure
              engagement within the app, length of time users spend within the
              app and within their match queues, average number of matches
              amongst users, and gather direct feedback to gauge early success
              or identify pitfalls; (2) Improve upon common glitches and fill
              usability gaps based on user feedback and usability tests; and (3)
              ideate future iterations of the app that may include supplemental
              usage scenarios/experiences like concert buddies or pro
              (networking with other musicians or industry people for those in
              the music business), or music meetups.
